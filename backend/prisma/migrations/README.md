# Prisma Migrations

This directory contains database migrations generated by Prisma.

## Initial Setup

To create the initial migration, run:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command will:
1. Create the initial migration based on the schema.prisma file
2. Apply the migration to your database
3. Generate the Prisma Client

## Requirements

Before running migrations, ensure:
1. PostgreSQL database is running
2. DATABASE_URL is configured in `.env` file
3. Database connection is accessible

## Migration Files

Migration files are automatically generated by Prisma and should not be edited manually.

Each migration contains:
- `migration.sql` - SQL statements to apply the migration
- Metadata files for Prisma to track migration state

## Running Migrations

- **Development**: `npx prisma migrate dev` - Creates and applies new migrations
- **Production**: `npx prisma migrate deploy` - Applies pending migrations without creating new ones
- **Reset**: `npx prisma migrate reset` - Drops database, recreates it, and applies all migrations (⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE)
